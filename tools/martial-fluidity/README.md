# Martial Fluidity — PTR 0.2.5-test.1

Close WoW, select PTR in Bear Cave Launcher, and update. No new executable or cache deletion required.

- In Class+, Hybrid and Hero, Rogue Vigor becomes Martial Fluidity: Combo points are retained even when switching targets. Its +10 maximum Energy remains. Classic is unchanged.
- With the talent learned, points survive target switches, target death, Vanish, leaving combat and normal logout. Finishers still spend points; player death and talent removal clear them. Maximum five points.
- Both portraits display points with a target. Without a target, only the player portrait displays them. Fixes floating target combo gems.
- Fixes native passive talent detection. Server repair is active on PTR; the owner verified the display correction.

Cumulative update retains CleanupBags, Auto-Attack Forever and all previous PTR client updates. Personal settings preserved. Main unchanged.

Integration: apply the narrow integration.patch to the pre-feature PTR core and add MartialFluidity.cpp/h to mod-hero-starting-path/src. Do not apply twice. EnablePlayerSettings=1 is required for persistence; preserve its previous configuration for rollback. payload contains the exact four client files. Build and core/module/Lua tests passed; broader spec/refund edge cases still warrant testing. Test scripts require local compiler/Lua dependencies. Private baselines and deployment records are excluded.
